        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <h2>Last Updated: <span id="lastUp">[05/11/24]</span></h2>
        
        <p>Thank you for using Speedy Squeegy! We're delighted to have you as a customer. 
            Before you proceed with our services, please read the following terms carefully.
        </p>
        
        <h2>1. Service Agreement</h2>
        <p>By using our window cleaning services, you agree to abide by these terms and conditions, 
            and that all services are provided by Speedy Squeegy, a California sole proprietorship 
            ("Speedy Squeegy", "we", "our"). The Customer listed on is referred to herein as “Customer”, “you”, or “your”.             
        </p>
        
        <h2>2. Scope of Service</h2>
        <p>We offer professional window cleaning services for residential properties. 
            Our services include interior window cleaning, 
            as well as the cleaning of window screens, sills, tracks, and frames.
        </p>
        
        <h2>3. Scheduling and Access</h2>
        <p>Customers are responsible for providing access to the windows that need cleaning.
            We require clear access to the windows, including the removal of any obstacles or items blocking the window area. 
            Please ensure that pets are secured during the cleaning process.
        </p>
        
        <h2>4. Payment</h2>
        <p>Payment for services is due upon completion unless otherwise agreed upon. 
            We accept cash, credit/debit cards, and e-transfers. A detailed invoice will be 
            provided for all services rendered. Payment is due at, or before the Services are 
            provided. If the Services are not paid for in advance, Speedy Squeegy will notify 
            the specified customer for all Services rendered, with payment due immediately when 
            the notification is provided based on the date or timestamp of our bill (the “Due Date”). 
            Unpaid amounts will accrue interest beginning 3 business days after the Due Date at a rate 
            of 1.5% per month, compounded monthly. We may stop work anytime payment is past due.

            our Services within 3 days of our date of Service, we will return to inspect and, if reasonably 
            necessary, correct the issue. Please observe that notice more than 3 days after our date of Service
